list-zfs-snapshots can list ZFS snapshots in various ways.


usage
-----

* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` without any arguments will list all ZFS
  volumes.  
  The output contains the snapshot names, relative and absolute
  snapshot sizes and is ordered by snapshot size.
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with the name of a ZFS pool as first
  argument will list the snapshot usage of only that pool.  
  The output contains the snapshot names, relative and absolute
  snapshot sizes and is ordered by snapshot size.
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with the name of a ZFS volume as first
  argument will list the individual snapshots in that volume.  
  The output contains the snapshot names, relative and absolute
  snapshot sizes and is ordered by snapshot creation time.  
  _Because of ZFS internals the used space per snapshot might not be
  correct.  The sum of the used space of all snapshots seldom matches
  the snapshot usage listed at the volume.  The volume value is
  correct.  Deleting individual snapshots will change the used space
  of other snapshots â€“ this is a byproduct of the copy-on-write
  semantics and completely normal._
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with the name of a snapshot as first
  argument followed by either `after` or `before` as second argument
  will list all other snapshots of in the corresponding volume that
  have been created either after or before the given snapshot.  
  The output contains only the snapshot names and is ordered by
  snapshot creation time.

* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with either `-h` or `--help` as first
  argument will show a brief help text.

The location can be overridden by setting the `ZFS_BINARY` environment variable.
