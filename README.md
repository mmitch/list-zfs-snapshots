list-zfs-snapshots can list ZFS snapshots in various ways.


usage
-----

* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` without any arguments will list the
  snapshot usage of all ZFS volumes.
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with the name of a ZFS pool as first
  argument will list the snapshot usage of only that pool.
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with the name of a ZFS volume as first
  argument will list the individual snapshots in that volume.  
  _Because of ZFS internals the used space per snapshot might not be
  correct.  The sum of the used space of all snapshots seldom matches
  the snapshot usage listed at the volume.  The volume value is
  correct.  Deleting individual snapshots will change the used space
  of other snapshots â€“ this is a byproduct of the copy-on-write
  semantics and completely normal._
  
* Calling `list-zfs-snapshots` with either `-h` or `--help` as first
  argument will show a brief help text.


configuration
-------------

By default the zfs binary is expected at `/sbin/zfs`.
The location can be overridden by setting the `ZFS_BINARY` environment variable.


dependencies
------------

- a not-so-ancient version of Perl
- the `Number::Bytes::Human` Perl module
- ZFS
